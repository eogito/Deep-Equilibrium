        <h1>The Science of Diving and Decompression</h1>
        
        <h2>Pressure Under Water</h2>
        <p>
            When diving, water pressure increases with depth according to the formula:
        </p>
        <p class="formula">P = ρgh</p>
        <p>
            Where P is pressure, ρ (rho) is the density of water (1000 kg/m³), 
            g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s²), and h is the depth in meters.
        </p>
        <p>
            At sea level, we experience 1 atmosphere (atm) of pressure. Every 10 meters of depth 
            in water adds approximately 1 additional atmosphere of pressure.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Henry's Law and Nitrogen Absorption</h2>
        <p>
            Henry's Law governs how gases dissolve in liquids under pressure:
        </p>
        <p class="formula">S = kP</p>
        <p>
            Where S is the solubility of a gas in a liquid, k is a constant specific to the gas and liquid, 
            and P is the partial pressure of the gas.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a diver descends, the increased pressure causes more nitrogen to dissolve in the bloodstream. 
            When ascending too quickly, this dissolved nitrogen can form bubbles in tissues and blood, 
            causing decompression sickness or "the bends."
        </p>
        
        <h2>Le Chatelier's Principle</h2>
        <p>
            Le Chatelier's principle states that when a system at equilibrium is subjected to a change, 
            the system will shift to counteract that change.
        </p>
        <p>
            In diving, the equilibrium is between nitrogen in solution and nitrogen as a gas:
        </p>
        <p class="formula">N₂(dissolved) ⇌ N₂(gas)</p>
        <p>
            When ascending (decreasing pressure), the equilibrium shifts toward the gaseous state, 
            potentially forming bubbles if the pressure change is too rapid.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Why Ascent Rate Matters</h2>
        <p>
            The percentage change in pressure becomes larger as you get closer to the surface:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Going from 120ft (4.5 atm) to 60ft (2.8 atm) is a 38% decrease in pressure</li>
            <li>Going from 60ft (2.8 atm) to 30ft (1.9 atm) is a 32% decrease in pressure</li>
            <li>Going from 30ft (1.9 atm) to 0ft (1 atm) is a 47% decrease in pressure</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This is why divers must slow down more as they approach the surface - the rate of gas 
            coming out of solution increases dramatically even with smaller changes in depth.
